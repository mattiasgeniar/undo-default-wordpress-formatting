This plugin undoes some of the default formatting that gets applied to new posts created via Wordpress.

Description
===========

Wordpress applies default text formatting that replaces characters such as '-', '--', quotes, ... to pretty HTML characters. This plugin was created to revert that back. This is especially useful for tech-oriented blogs that need the original input because they may contain commands that need to be executed.

Installation
============

1. upload the directory "undo_wordpress_default_formatting" to your wp-content/plugins directory
2. activate the plugin from your Wordpress 'Plugins' menu

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

#### The characters get replaced to something else than my original, why is that?

Wordpress changes a few characters to the same HTML entity character. I can not guess what the original character was, so I'm using a 'best effort' way of converting the HTML character back to the original one. Sometimes, it'll be wrong.
